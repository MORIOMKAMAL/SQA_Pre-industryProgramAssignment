TASK 1 — Complete Test Cases for Login, Registration & OTP Verification.

Day 1 : Requirement Breakdown + Test Coverage Design

Goal : what test need to be done , how to map the flow of the system correctly . 

Reference UI visit 
Login-Registration-OTP flow map
Boundary , negative , security test condition identify 
test case matrix draft


Step1 : REFERENCE URL OVESERVE

Visit Registration page in Reference URL https://otp-verified-login.lovable.app/register

Flow 01: Registration page 

Name field
E-mail field
Password
Registration button
OTP screen redirect 

Flow 02: Log In

Email/phone field 
password
Login --> OTP page

Flow 03:OTP verification 

OTP input (6 digit)
Resend OTP
Verify


Step 2:System Requirement Breakdown 

Registration Requirements :

 OTP cannot be reused



Step 5: Create Test Case Table Structure

create column :

TC ID
Module 
Scenario
Pre-condition 
Steps 
Expected Result 
Type


Note : Tomorrow will just fill in the scenario.


DAY SUMMARY
